TSP; APCS PD9 MKS21X Final Project

	The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route 
that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical 
computer science.
	In this version of TSP, we will be using the brute force option. 
	In the Traveling Salesman Project folder, there is no GUI display. You can set the number of cities generated and their locations are randomized. It will print 
out the routes and the shortest route and the shortest distance.
	in the Traveling Salesman Project 2 folder, there is a simple GUI display containing lines to show the route taken to visit each city. You can set each individual city 
and their location or let it be randomized. It will print out the shortest distance and route.


Instructions for Traveling Salesman Project:
1-Javac Tester.java
2-run Tester

Instructions for Traveling Salesman Project 2:
1- Open Tester.java
2- Input Cities and their locations by hand OR let the locations be randomized
3- Javac Tester.java
4- Run Tester



Notes:
The lack of commiting,pushing, branching and merging on the github is due to the fact that both Alvin and Hao Yu only do work on one respective device. Alvin and Hao Yu kept 
saving files on their device instead of commiting. Furthermore, work was done whilst screensharing on Skype.
